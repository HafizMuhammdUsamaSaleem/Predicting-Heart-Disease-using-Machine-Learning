# Predicting-Heart-Disease-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains code for a machine learning project to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The project is based on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
## Features
The project includes the following features:

* Data cleaning and pre-processing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature selection and engineering
* Model selection and tuning
* Evaluation of model performance
## Benefits
By predicting the presence of heart disease in patients, this project can have several potential benefits, such as:

Early detection and prevention of heart disease
Improved patient outcomes and quality of life
Reduced healthcare costs and resource utilization
## Requirements
The project requires the following software and packages to run:

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
## Usage
To run the project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file in a Python environment with the required packages installed.

## Credits
The project was developed by [Your Name] as part of a machine learning course. The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
